# DJ-gig-CMS
A CMS that organizes DJ's gigs, and has different promoters that create those gigs. DJs can have different genres they play associated with them, and create genres as well. This project utilizes Sinatra with Active Record.

A promoter can create/edit/delete their own gig and account, and add DJs to the gigs.
A DJ can view gigs they were added to, and create/edit/delete their own accounts. 
The main gigs directory can be displayed without needing a log in, and can also be accessed by both users.
